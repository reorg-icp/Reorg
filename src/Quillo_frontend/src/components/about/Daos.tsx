        <p className="title">Tokenization and AI-Driven Tokenomics</p>
        <p className="desc">
          Approved startups undergo a tokenization process. Our AI model,
          trained on tokenomics, recommends an optimal token structure based on
          the startup’s business model, including total token supply and
          transfer fees. Tokens are created and launched on the platform, ready
          for investor participation.

          Investors join Reorg DAO and pool their funds together to support
          promising web3 projects. The DAO collectively vets and votes on which
          projects to fund, ensuring a democratic and transparent

          Once a project is approved, a digital agreement and revenue-sharing
          model are established. Funds are transferred to the startup’s account,
          and tokens are distributed to investors. Investors participate in
          ongoing governance through the DAO, contributing to key decisions and
          oversight.
